## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) - JS framework
- [MAPBOX GL JS](https://mapbox.org) - JS library

### What I learned

- How best to separate concerns in VueJS Single File Components
- How to integrate an external API into a VueJS project
- Better understanding of asynchronous methods of Single File Components

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

- Being more comfortable separating concerns in VueJS Single File Components
-Being more comfortable working with multiple external libraries and APIs for extensive web application development
- Using a CSS framework (preferably TailwindCSS) to speed up development time
- Learning how to implement new features like the drag and drop functionality
- Attaining the level of intuition needed to create a fully functional website

### Useful resources

- [VueJS Official Guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) - This helped me shed light on various ways i can implement a particular feature.
- [MapBox Official Documentation](https://docs.mapbox.com/) - This helped me understand the functionalities the MapBox GL JS library has and helped me integrate them efficiently
